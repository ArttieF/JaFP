# The name of this map
# This defines the display name of this map, you can change this at any time.
# Default is the id of this map
name: "Nether"

# The path to the save-folder of the world to render.
world: "saves\\New World\\DIM-1"

# A lower value makes the map sorted first (in lists and menus), a higher value makes it sorted later.
# The value needs to be an integer but it can be negative.
# Default is 0
sorting: 100

# The position on the world where the map will be centered if you open it.
# You can change this at any time.
# This defaults to the world-spawn if you don't set it.
#start-pos: [500, -820]

# The color of thy sky as a hex-color
# You can change this at any time.
# Default is "#7dabff"
sky-color: "#290000"

# Defines the ambient light-strength that every block is receiving, regardless of the sunlight/blocklight.
# 0 is no ambient light, 1 is fully lighted.
# You can change this at any time.
# Default is 0
ambient-light: 0.6

# Defines the skylight level that the sky of the world is emitting.
# This should always be equivalent to the maximum in-game sky-light for that world!
# If this is a normal overworld dimension, set this to 15 (max).
# If this is a normal nether or end dimension, set this to 0 (min).
# Changing this value requires a re-render of the map.
# Default is 15
world-sky-light: 0

# BlueMap tries to omit all blocks that are below this Y-level and are not visible from above-ground.
# More specific: Block-Faces that have a sunlight/skylight value of 0 are removed.
# This improves the performance of the map on slower devices by a lot, but might cause some blocks to disappear that should normally be visible.
# Changing this value requires a re-render of the map.
# Set to a very high value to remove caves everywhere (e.g. 10000)
# Set to a very low value to remove nothing and render all caves (e.g. -10000)
# Default is 55 (slightly below water-level)
remove-caves-below-y: -10000

# With this value set to true, BlueMap uses the block-light value instead of the sky-light value to "detect caves".
# (See: remove-caves-below-y)
# Default is false
cave-detection-uses-block-light: false

# With the below values you can limit the map-render.
# This can be used to ignore the nethers ceiling or render only a certain part of a world.
# Changing this values might require a re-render of the map, already rendered tiles outside the limits will not be deleted.
# Default is no min or max value (= infinite bounds)
#min-x: -4000
#max-x: 4000
#min-z: -4000
#max-z: 4000
#min-y: 50
max-y: 90

# Using this, BlueMap pretends that every Block out of the defined render-bounds is AIR,
# this means you can see the blocks where the world is cut (instead of having a see-through/xray view).
# This has only an effect if you set some render-bounds above.
# Changing this value requires a re-render of the map.
# Default is true
render-edges: true

# This defines the storage-config that will be used to save this map.
# You can find your storage configs next to this config file in the 'storages'-folder.
# Default is "file"
storage: "file"

# Normally BlueMap detects if a chunk has not yet generated it's light-data and omits rendering those chunks.
# If this is set to true BlueMap will render Chunks even if there is no light-data!
# This can be useful for example if some mod prevents light-data from being saved correctly.
# However, this also has a few drawbacks:
# - For those chunks, every block will always be fully lit
# - Night-mode might not work correctly
# - Caves will always be rendered (ignoring the 'renderCaves' setting)
# Default is false
ignore-missing-light-data: false

# Here you can define any static marker-sets with markers that should be displayed on the map.
# If you need dynamic markers, you can use any plugin that integrates with BlueMap's API.
